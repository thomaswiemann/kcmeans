Description: Implementation of the KCMeans regression estimator studied by 
    Wiemann (2023; <arXiv:2311.17021>) for expectation function estimation conditional on 
    categorical variables. Computation leverages the unconditional KMeans 
    implementation in one dimension using dynamic programming algorithm of
    Wang and Song (2011; <PMID:27942416>), allowing for global solutions in time polynomial in 
    the number of observed categories.
